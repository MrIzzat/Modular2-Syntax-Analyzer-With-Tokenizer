# Modular2-Syntax-Analyzer-With-Tokenizer
This was the compiler project. I built the Tokenizer using FSAs. The Syntax Analyzer was built using recursive descent.

The project as is requires javafx but the javafx part can be removed and it'll work perfectly.

I only inlucded the source files as everything else seems unnecessary.
